# MazeRobot

Program a robot and watch it solve mazes!
I made this around 2009 while learning Python, and recently rediscovered it.

# Usage

`python run.py` (or chmod it).

I don't think I ever wrote any documentation for the robot instructions, but it should be pretty easy to follow--they don't do a whole lot.
